# chemITryFlask

A flask app that uses the cheminformatic tool, OpenBabel in the back-end to generate SVG images of chemical structures, generate a tanimoto similarity heatmap, euclidean network plot, PCA, and other exploratory data analysis visuals. Also includes a curated database of approved drug molecules. Purely for fun.
