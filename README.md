# chemITryFlask

A flask app that uses OpenBabel, mysql and bokeh in the back-end to generate SVG images of chemical structures. Capable of doing sub-structure search with highlighting, PCA analysis, tanimoto similaritiy heatmap. Also includes a curated database of approved drug molecules. Working on D3 javascript visuals and SOM map. Purely for fun.
